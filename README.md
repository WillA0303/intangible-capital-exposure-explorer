# Intangible Capital Exposure Explorer

Single-page web app to explore how exposed a set of large listed companies are
to intangible assets and intangible investment.

The app:

- Uses a built-in static dataset of large global companies (illustrative only).
- Computes a simple 0–100 "intangible exposure score" and tiers (low/medium/high).
- Lets you filter by region, sector, exposure level and size.
- Shows:
  - An overview of the filtered universe.
  - A scatter plot of intangible assets (% assets) vs R&D + marketing (% sales).
  - A sortable table of all metrics.
  - A profile view for each company with small charts.

**Tech stack**

- HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript
- Chart.js for visualisation
